# Predictiong-Enzyme-Function-With-Neural-Networks

Description

This notebook presents the implementation and evaluation of two neural network architectures—a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN)—for the classification of enzyme functions based on embedded amino acid sequences.

The dataset comprises labeled entries representing different enzyme classes, with features extracted through embeddings.

This analysis highlights the importance of addressing class imbalance and improving model performance through various strategies, including data augmentation.
